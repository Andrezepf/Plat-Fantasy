                After the introductory scenes, you'll be controlling a chocobo, Boko. You cannot dismount just yet. Head
                east and north to the meteor. After the tutorial battle, head NE to Galuf. After Galuf and Lenna leave,
                there is a chest to the SE, hidden under the leaves, containing a Phoenix Down. Then return to Boko to
                the W and leave.

                <h3>Item Collection Note:</h3>

                <p>Most towns have both items and chests that can be found by the player. The in-game map doesn't point
                    out
                    where these are exactly, but it does track how many you have found in each town and how many are
                    left to
                    find. For the most part, this guide will not point out where exactly these items/chests are, unless
                    they
                    are especially tricky, because most can be found with relatively little trouble just by searching
                    normally. Most items are invisible and can be found in grass, pots, and the like around town.</p>

                <p>This guide will also note any item that is missable.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="box">
                <h3>Brave Blade /Chicken Knife Note:</h3>

                <p>It's worth knowing now that much, much later in the game, you'll be able to either pick up the Brave
                    Blade or the Chicken Knife. You have to pick one or the other - you can't get both.</p>

                <p>The reason why this is worth knowing now is that: the attack power of these weapons will depend on
                    how
                    many times you flee from battle.</p>

                <p>The Brave Blade has a starting Attack Power of 150, and grants +5 Strength, but will decrease every
                    time
                    you flee from battle, even before you get it. So, if you want the Brave Blade, you should never,
                    ever
                    flee.</p>

                <p> The Chicken Knife is the opposite, which powers up the more you escape, capping at 127 power at 254
                    escapes. The Chicken Knife technically has higher damage potential than the Brave Blade, due to how
                    it
                    incorporates the agility stat into the damage formula. However, it also has a 25% chance of making
                    the
                    party run from the fight when used.</p>

                <p>The choice is yours which you want to use.</p>
            </div>


            <li>Back on the overworld, head to the NW for a scene in a canyon. You'll begin to head north, fighting two
                battles
                with goblins on the way, before being reunited with Lenna and Galuf.</li>

            <li>Back on the world map again, continue heading north until you are in the cave.</li>

            <li>The small cave is sometimes referred to as the 'Road to Tule' and has a healing spring, three different
                enemies,
                and one chest. Remember to use the in-game map to check for your item collection</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Steel Bat</li>
                <li> Devil Crab</li>
                <li>Stroper</li>
            </ul>
            <li>You'll soon enter the Pirate's Hideout, and after some scenes, you'll be on the Pirate Ship.</li>

            <div id="box">
                <h3>Item Collection Note:</h3>

                <p>
                    If you check your item collection, you'll see you have only 1/4 items from the Pirate Hideout. Don't
                    worry,
                    you'll get the rest shortly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="box">
                <h3>Bestiary Note:</h3>

                <p>
                    Due to Final Fantasy V's world structure, more bestiary entries are missable than in previous games.
                    While these
                    three enemies are NOT missable, it's in your best interest to encounter enemies as early as possible
                    to add them
                    to your bestiary.
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>
                When you first get control of the ship, a crewmate will ask to take over control. Say no so that you can
                maintain control of the ship on the world map. Then, head NW to the first town of the game, Tule.
            </li>
            <h2>Tule</h2>
            <li>
                Here, there are 3 items and 3 chests in the west house, which is a tutorial house that teaches some
                basics of
                the game. There are 5 other items scattered throughout town:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Barrel east of Inn</li>
                <li>Two in barrels/crates in the center of town.</li>
                <li>One in a bush in the far north and west of town.</li>
                <li>One in a crate to the far north and east.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Play the piano (1/8), you have to sit on the stool and watch the dancers first. There are 8 pianos in
                the game
                and you get an achievement (and a Bard Song) for playing all of them.
            </li>
            <li>You can go upstairs to see a scene with Faris.</li>
            <li>Buy some armor and a broadsword for Galuf. Buy Magic.</li>
            <li>
                Remember the Brave Blade / Chicken Knife note above about fleeing from battle, this guide won't mention
                this
                again.
            </li>
            <h2>To the Wind Shrine</h2>
            <li>On the world map, there are three new enemies you can fight outside of Tule.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Killer Bee</li>
                <li>Nutkin</li>
                <li>Stray Cat (somewhat rare)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Near the Torna Canal to the east, on the little strips of land, you can fight three more enemies.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gatling</li>
                <li>Big Horn</li>
                <li>Bandersnatch (somewhat dangerous, gain a few levels before fighting)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Wind Shrine</h2>
            <li>
                Once you've gotten the bestiary entries on the world map, head to the Wind Shrine far to the NE of Tule.
                There
                are 4 enemies and 4 chests.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Black Goblin</li>
                <li>White Serpent</li>
                <li>Moldwynd</li>
                <li>Mani Wizard</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Go to the west room for a scene. The pot is a full-heal. Talk to the NPC left of the pot for 5x free
                Potions.</li>
            <li>
                This dungeon is pretty short, you'll be able to get 3 of the 4 chests before fighting the Wing Raptor
                boss.
                (Check out our Final Fantasy V Boss Guide for detailed strategies, if you need them). The last chest is
                in the
                room after the boss, in the SE corner. Make sure to check the in-game map to verify a complete Item
                Collection.
            </li>
            <li>You'll then see a long scene about the crystals, then leave the dungeon through a portal to the north.
            </li>
            <li>
                Listen to Boko's Jobs tutorial if you want. Jobs are a huge part of FF5, and though this walkthrough
                will guide
                you to some extent, you can also consult our FF5 Jobs guide for help with the best jobs and skills, if
                needed.

                <h3>Blue Magic Tutorial</h3>

                <p>
                    You now have your first classes, including the series debut of the Blue Mage. The Blue Mage can
                    learn certain
                    abilities from enemies if they are hit with that attack in battle. This guide will list the earliest
                    opportunity
                    to learn every Blue Magic in the game.
                </p>

                <p>Some tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only one character needs to learn Blue Magic for every character to be able to use it. </li>
                    <li>The character doesn't have to survive the attack to learn it.</li>
                    <li>The battle cannot be fled, it must be won to learn the Blue Magic.</li>
                    <li>
                        After leveling up the Blue Mage class a few times, the character can set the Learn passive
                        ability, so they can
                        learn Blue Magic while using another class. You do need to have Learn equipped, however.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    We also have a separate guide for Blue Magic Locations, but this walkthrough will also mention the
                    earliest you
                    can learn each skill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Blue Magic you can learn now: <br>
                    Goblin Punch - from Black Goblin in Wind Shrine <br>
                    Aero - from Moldwynd in Wind Shrine. <br>
                    Vampire - from Steel Bat in Road to Tule Cave
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>
                To proceed, go back to Tule and enter the big north house, and talk to the NPC. After several scenes,
                leave town
                for another scene, then enter your boat for yet another scene. Then, head south and back into the Pirate
                Hideout
                / Cave.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once back at the pirate area, you can press a skull button to open a room to the NW with three more
                chests,
                finally completing the item collection here. Boko is in another room, too. Now leave.
            </li>
            <h1>2. To The Water Crystal</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Torna Canal</h2>
            <li>
                Now go to the canal, east from Tule, in the pincer-like area. The Torna Canal is an easy 'dungeon' with
                one path
                and no chests. However, both enemies here are missable, so make sure to encounter them.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sucker (MISSABLE)</li>
                <li>Octokraken (MISSABLE)</li>
            </ul>
            <div id="box">
                <h3>Missable Enemies Note</h3>
                <p>Encounter Sucker and Octokraken in Torna Canal</p>
            </div>
            <li>
                Use lightning on the Karlabos boss. BTW, once you encounter the boss, you won't be able to return to the
                Wind
                Shrine/Tule area for a while.
            </li>
            <h2>Ship Graveyard</h2>
            <li>After some scenes, you'll now be in Ship Graveyard. There are 4 enemies here.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Skeleton</li>
                <li>Calcruthl</li>
                <li>Undead Hulk</li>
                <li>Mind Flusher</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Just as you get off the ship, head to the south of the plank east of the ship, onto the rock. After a
                bit, you
                should jump your way to a Flail item.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although it doesn't look like it, the rest of the dungeon is pretty linear. You'll eventually reach one
                small
                fork where you can head to a door to the north or south (head north for a chest first, then south).
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll then see a scene where the crew realizes Faris is a woman. After that, head through the path
                until you
                are in the outer area again, then head east and south. You can enter a ship that has a world map and
                three
                chests, which should finish the Item Collection in the area. If you are missing a chest, backtrack to
                find it.
            </li>
            <li>
                You'll then fight the Siren boss. After three turns, she'll turn undead, and you can cast Fire. You
                can't use
                Phoenix Downs btw.
            </li>
            <h2>Overworld - Carwen Area</h2>
            <li>
                After that, you'll end up back on the world map. There's one new enemy here, a Tatou, along with a few
                old
                enemies. Head south to the town of Carwen.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gatling</li>
                <li>Big Horn</li>
                <li>Tatou (NEW)</li>
                <li>Garula (NEW)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                You can encounter a Garula west of Carwen in a random battle. It will not attack or yield exp. It is
                marked in
                your bestiary though, so encounter it once.
            </li>
            <h2>Carwen</h2>
            <li>There is a bunch of new stuff to buy. There are three hidden items:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>One in a barrel in the center of town.</li>
                <li>One in a secret passage in the pub (Use the Thief Skill Find Passages to help).</li>
                <li>One in a crate south of the pub. Head straight south from the sign.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make sure to play the Piano in the pub (2/8).</li>
            <li>
                To continue, you need to talk to a green-haired woman south of the pub, then talk to a man upstairs in
                the pub.
                Then leave town.
            </li>
            <li>The next destination is North Mountain, which is to the north.</li>
            <h2>North Mountain</h2>
            <li>
                The North Mountain is a linear dungeon with 4 enemies and 2 easy chests. Simply use your map to find the
                two
                chests.
            </li>
            <ul>

                <p>
                    Flash - From Headstone on North Mountain. You have to use an Ether on them, which you may only have
                    a few to
                    spare. You can easily get this elsewhere too, so don't worry if you can't get it now.

                Af ter the scene, you are now flying on Hiryu. Go to Castle Tycoon (fly all the way back where you

            <h2>Castle Tycoon</h2>
            <li>
                There's a hidden path on the northeast side of the courtside that leads to the east tower, with two
                chests.
                Oddly enough, your map screen doesn't seem to count these for Item Collection. It's possible these are
                not
                counted because Lone Wolf the Pickpocket can steal these (more on him later).
            </li>
            <li>You'll see a scene if you enter the throne room.</li>
            <li>
                Afterward, you can explore the full castle to get the rest of the chests and items. None of them are too
                hard to
                find.
            </li>
            <li>A west passage in the courtyard only opens after seeing the scene in the throne room.</li>
            <h2>Walse & Walse Castle</h2>
            <li>
                Now head to Walse, the town (south of Carwen). The single hidden item here is in the SW house, accessed
                by the
                moat. You can shop a lot, including magic for Time Mages and Summoners you don't have yet.

                <h3>Missable Item Note:</h3>
                <p>
                    The Iron Shield and Kenpo Gi you can buy here are technically missable. So buy one of each
                    if you want.

            </div>
            <li>
                Then head to Walse Castle. Go into the upper right room from the entrance, then down the stairs to find
                three
                items.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid the stairs downwards in the entrance room for now. There are more items, chests, and enemies in Walse
                Castle that you *can* get now, but there are enemies that are much higher level than what you should be at
                this
                point, so let's avoid for now. (Specifically, the Jackanapes).

                <li>
                    If for some reason you ignore this advice, don't let out Lone Wolf from the prison. Just don't. More on this
                    later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If for some reason you ignore this advice, you can abuse the Thief's Scram ability if you want, but keep the
                    Brave Blade in mind, too.

                <li>We will come back here, I promise.</li>

            <h2>Walse Tower</h2>
            <li>
                Once you are ready, head to Walse Tower, NW of the castle on the overworld. Walse Tower has 5 enemies and 4
                chests.
            </li>

            <div id="box">
                <h3>One-Time-Only Area Warning - Walse Tower</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Walse Tower is a one-time-only area, meaning once it is complete, you can never revisit it. This means
                    you'll
                    want to encounter the 5 enemies here and collect the 4 chests before you beat the Garula boss.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    It's important to note, for Item Collection purposes, that once the tower is completed, you will no longer
                    be
                    able to check your in-game map for chest completion. So, to be certain you got everything in the tower, make
                    sure you check before you beat Garula.
                </p>
            </div>
            <li>
                Be sure to encounter these enemies. While some of them are technically able to be found later, just make it
                easy
                on yourself and get them all now.
            </li>

            <li>The tower is otherwise linear. A few chests are up climbable vines. Boss hits hard but is doable.</li>
            <li>
                After the boss and getting new jobs (you'll pick up 5 crystal shards, 1 you'll get much later), return to
                Walse
                Castle and talk to the king in his bedroom. Then head to the meteorite where the tower was, and warp to a
                new
                region.
