            3. To The Fire Crystal
Karnak Region
You are now in the Karnak Region, which has new monsters.
Aegir
Zu
Wild Nakk (forests)
Grass Tortoise
Head west through the forests and south to reach the town of Karnak.
Karnak
Play the Piano (3/8) in the pub.
Karnak has one item to collect, but you won't be able to get it for a while.
Go to the weapon shop. You'll notice the prices are discounted from what they normally are. It's best to buy a Mythril Hammer at a strangely low price. As soon as you do this, you'll be thrown in jail. Nice.
Once in jail, wait some time, run around a bit, and eventually, you'll talk to Cid. After some scenes, you'll regain control. Go ahead and leave Karnak Castle and head back to the town. Your map will list several items in the castle, but you'll get these later.
There are a bunch of items and magic to buy. Now's a good time to gain some money, train some of your jobs - old and new - and improve your equipment.
Blue Magic Note

??? - Wild Nakk in forests near Karnak.
A Detour Back to Walse Castle for Shiva
After some training and getting upgraded gear at Karnak, now is a good time to return to Walse Castle to get Shiva.
Note there are still some items and bestiary entries here we will hold off until later. We are just getting Shiva for now.
Missable Summon Note

Shiva is actually a missable Bestiary Entry and Summon if you never get her before leaving the first world.
Go down the stairs in the entrance room that you avoided before. You can head down more stairs to the dungeon area but do NOT free the wolf.
This is Lone Wolf the Pickpocket. If you let him out, you'll lose out on some treasures later. Just leave him be. Note that the treasures he takes do NOT seem to count for item collection, but seriously, there is no reason to let him out.
Instead, in the first basement, head through the door to the south (NOT the upper right, we'll do this later). After following the path to the waterfall, you'll fight Shiva and Ice Commanders. Beat her and get her as a summon.
Fire-Powered Ship
Now, head back to Karnak, and enter the Fire Ship south of it. By the way, this is NOT a one-time-only dungeon, though it might seem like it.

Back-to-Back Dungeons + Time Limit Note

While the Fire-Powered Ship is not a one-time-only dungeon, it will lead directly into Karnak Castle afterward, which is a one-time-only dungeon AND has a time limit.

So, before Fire-Powered Ship (or at least before beating the boss of Fire-Powered Ship), make sure you have a good solid save point beforehand and you are happy with your party.
Fire-Powered Ship Enemies
Crew Dust
Poltergeist
Defeater
Motor Trap
Blue Magic Note

Self-Destruct - Motor Trap in Fire-Powered Ship. Use a thunder ability on them.

If you couldn't get it before, you can get Flash from the Crew Dust.
Quick guide through Fire-Powered Ship:
In the first room, grab 4 chests by entering every room EXCEPT the NE one. Leave that one for last, and then head through it, and activate the elevator.
Grab another chest, then continue to the next elevator. A World Map will be found along the way if you didn't pick it up in the Ship Graveyard.
Go through the nearby air vent and along the path. Soon enough you'll be in a room with 4 vents on the south wall. Head through the east-most vent to get one item after a bit of walking, you'll end up back here. Then go to the second-east-most vent for another item. Then enter the vent 2nd from the left.
Head up the nearby stairs, flip the switch, and enter the door for another item.
Return and go through the door. Don't go on the conveyor, it returns to the 4 air ducts. Instead, head through the door on the left for a save point.
In the switch/platform room, hit every switch as you come across them, except the bottom-center one. You'll pick up the last chest. Then go through the door.
Boss (Liquid Flame) is weak to blizzard.
After some scenes, you'll be in the Karnak Castle basement.
Karnak Castle Dungeon
One-Time-Only Dungeon Warning - Karnak Castle

As warned before, Karnak Castle is a one-time-only dungeon, and it's a tricky one at that. It also has a time limit, and there are missable enemies, chests. If you do not complete the dungeon before the time limit it is game over.

There are also some Blue Magics you can learn here (though you can also learn these later.) For completionists, this zone can be pretty stressful.

We will try and guide you through this section as thoroughly as possible in getting all the enemies, items, and Blue Magic.

By the way, it's worth noting here that oftentimes, 'monster-in-a-box' encounters are semi-random. (Not which boxes specifically lead to monster encounters, just the monster encounter itself is not a scripted set encounter of enemies.)
Karnak Castle Enemies
Sergeant (missable! Kill one in a random battle. They will flee if left for last.)
Sorcerer (missable, can find in a box)
Cur Nakk (missable, can find in a box)
Gigas (missable, can find in a box)
Blue Magic Note

Aera - from Gigas in a monster-in-a-box
Death Claw - from Iron Claw boss at the end of Karnak Castle.

Again, both of these Blue Magic spells can be obtained later, relatively easily, so don't worry if you can't get them here.
Karnak Castle Walkthrough
Go back one room and heal from the pot. Then go back to the save point and SAVE.
Head straight north and get the chest in the jail cell.
Go around to the NE side of the room for a chest with monsters and an Elixir. Then exit to the NE.
In the library-ish room, head east, open a chest for a monster fight. Then do the same on the left side.
Keep following the path until you get to the main hallway with the ornate carpet. Then head to the NW room. Grab the chest with money then enter the nearby stairs.
Follow the path to another monster chest. Then return to the previous chest.
Here, there are two more chests in this room with monsters and elixirs. Head south through the door, then u-turn up to the next room
Grab all the chests in this room. You should have 12/15 before you leave. Head through the stairs to the NE.
Follow the path to another monster chest with a Main Gauche. Then return to the room with a bunch of open chests and head south.
Go along the east and west to get the last two chests. Make sure you have 15/15. Make sure you check this in your in-game map now, because you won't be able to later. Hopefully, you have some time left to spare.
When you leave the castle's main gates, you'll encounter one last scripted encounter with a Sergeant and Cur Nakks.
Missable Bestiary Entry Note

For the boss fight, you want to make sure to kill the Cur Nakks and leave the Sergeant alive. After the Cur Nakks die, the boss will transform into Iron Claw. Not only should you do this to add him to your bestiary, but you can also learn Death Claw from him. This isn't the only place to learn Death Claw though, so don't worry if you beat him without picking it up.
After the scene collecting the fire crystal shards, return to Karnak.
Karnak Revisited
Take a breath after the tense dungeon section, phew.
You want to talk to Cid on the top floor of the bar.
You can collect the one hidden item from the top of the wall around Karnak now, finishing the Item Collection.
Your next task is to head to the west of Karnak, down to the Library of Ancients.
Blue Magic Note

With the new Beastmaster class, you'll want someone to learn the Control skill. This is used to gain several Blue Magic abilities by controlling enemies and having them use the skill directly.

There are a handful of new skills you can get now.

Aqua Breath - from Dhorme Chimera in the desert near the Library of Ancients.
Transfusion - Mythril Dragon near the Library of the Ancients. Must be controlled by a Beastmaster.
Missile - Motor Trap back in the Fire-Powered Ship. Must be controlled by a Beastmaster.
Enemies near Library of Ancients
Silent Bee
Mythril Dragon
Dhorme Chimera (desert, somewhat tough)
4. To The Earth Crystal
Library of Ancients
The Library of Ancients is a dungeon area. *Eventually* the library will disappear, but not for a long time. Still, grab the chests and enemies while you are here.
Page 32
Page 64
Page 128
Page 256
Blue Magic Note

Level 5 Death - from Page 64. Hopefully at least one but not all of your characters are at level 20 here. Don't want everyone to die, right?
Off-Guard - From Page 256. Must be controlled with a Beastmaster.
Moon Flute - From Page 256.
Aera - In case you didn't get it from a Gigas in Karnak Castle, you can get it here from Page 32.
Magic Hammer - From Byblos boss in the Library.
There's a pot in the 2nd room of the library that will heal you.
You can go up another floor and fight the east-most book. All the book enemies can be encountered randomly, too.
The dungeon itself is somewhat weird, where crossing over certain paths will move others. In the first room, you want to make your way to a bookshelf in the NE and examine it to fall down a hole.
Head South and grab a chest.
In the next room, head up a ladder and examine the wall and go through. Head along the path, and eventually, you'll fight Ifrit in a book.
Head back to the fork go through the door you haven't gone through before.
You can head through a gap in the bookshelf here to get a Ninja Suit.
As you continue along the path, you'll find a Phoenix Down, the last item in the dungeon.
Eventually, you'll find a save point, and later you'll fight Byblos. Weak to fire, can learn blue magic Magic Hammer.
Talk to Mid, then leave the dungeon.
Another Quick Detour To Walse Castle
We waited for Level-5 Death to do this. You can return to Walse now to complete the Item Collection. Head down the stairs in then through the NE door. Use Level 5 Death on the Jackanapes. They are still probably too difficult to defeat in any other way. You can finally complete the Item Collection here.

Getting Another Ship
Head back to Cid in the Pub in Karnak.
Head back to the Fire-Powered Ship. After the scene, talk to Cid for another scene. Then you have a new ship.
You can still fight enemies in the Fire-Powered Ship if you need to.
A note: As you sail on the open ocean, don't enter the town of Crescent on the moon-shaped island just yet.
With a new ship, there are several new places you can go. Here are some of the new monsters you can get. (Use the World Map item from your item bag to see the dots on the map for some places you can go with the ship)
Sea Monsters
Sahagin
Thunder Anemone
Sea Ibis (around the Crescent isle)
Corbett (in the area outside of the inner sea. Kinda tough at this point)
Jachol Area (to the SW)
Bomb
Doublizard
Bio Soldier
Istory Area (to the NW)
Mythril Dragon
Black Flame
Stone Golem
Mini Dragon (forests)
Crescent Area (the obviously crescent-shaped area. Again, don't enter then town yet.)
Doublizard
Bio Soldier
Harvester
Black Flame
Prototype - 2nd Island South of Crescent. Very tough. Use Control and have it self-destruct itself.
Jachol and Jachol Cave (SW part of the map)
Jachol doesn't have any hidden items, but does have some shopping to do, such as the useful Sage's Surplice. There is also a piano in the pub (4/8).
In Jachol Cave you can meet Nutkins (meh) and Skull Eaters. These only have 1 HP, but very high stats otherwise. Use a Geomancer's Gaia ability, scroll items (can get Thunder Scrolls from Thunder Anemones), or run (consider Brave Blade..).
The dungeon itself is pretty easy otherwise, check the skulls and empty chests for switches. For the wall of skulls, simply stand in front and wait a bit to see which skull to press.
Note: There are three chests to get in the cave's second room, but it looks like only twoof them count for the item collection, according to your map. The chest with the Blitz Whip chest can be taken by Lone Wolf if you let him out of the Walse jail. It seems like these chests do not count for the collection.
Istory (Far NW of the world map)
Blue Magic Note

Dark Spark - From Black Flame near Istory.
Missables Note

Romeo's Ballad - Learned in Istory by talking to the Bard near the sheep pen. This has to be obtained before leaving for the second world later in the game
Ramuh - Technically missable if you throw away the Ramuh item after beating him. Don't be dumb.
Ramuh can be found in a random battle in the forests near Istory. Beat him up. Use the item he drops to learn him. Technically missable if, for some reason, you throw away the item.
Istory has really expensive accessories you probably don't need to buy right now.
Run around the flower circle to get Toad
Talk to the NW sheep from behind, then talk to the Bard to learn Romeo's Ballad. This is missable if you don't grab this before leaving the first world.
Crescent
Blue Magic Note

Flame Thrower - from Prototype on the 2nd island to the SW of Crescent Isle. He has very high stats, but a beastmaster can control and self-destruct it pretty easily.
Talk to the Minstrel in the SE of town to learn Mighty March.
Piano Here too (5/8)
Some weapons to buy
No hidden items
Go to the Forest south of Crescent to find a Black Chocobo. After a scene, you'll have Ranger and Bard jobs, plus a way to fly. Black Chocobo can land in forests only.
Lix
Using the Black Chocobo, head to Lix, an isolated town at the very north of the map, surrounded by mountains, near the Wind Shrine.
Missables Note

Alluring Air - Talk to the bard in Bartz's house after examining the music box. This has to be obtained before leaving for the second world later in the game
No hidden items
Buy scrolls, (water is useful for the next boss)
You can buy ethers here
Go to Bartz's old house in the NW and examine the pink music box for a scene. Then talk to the bard resident to learn Alluring Air (Missable!)
Rest at Inn for a second scene.
Talk to the scholar-like NPC in the north center of town for a third scene.
Desert of the Shifting Sands & Gohn
Now fly to the Library of Ancients (Center of the west continent) to talk to Cid & Mid. Then head west to the Desert of the Shifting Sands.
In some versions of Final Fantasy V, enemies here are missable, though later versions allow these enemies to be encountered in the third world. Just to be safe, find them now.
Sandboil
Desert Killer
Sand Bear
Missable Item Note

Javelin is a spear that can only be found from stealing from Sand Bears, for some reason. It's not a good weapon, but this is the only place to get them, if you want.
A note on Stealing

Some valuable items can be obtained by stealing them from enemies or bosses. None of the enemies before this point had significant steals, so I hadn't mentioned this until now. 

There are two different types of stealable items that any enemy can hold: common steals and rare steals. When a character uses Steal, they have a 40% chance to steal an item. If you have the Thieve's Gloves equipped (obtained from the Fire-powered ship), this increases to 80%.

If the steal is successful, you have a 123/128 chance to steal the normal, common steal item. Items that are considered rare steals only have a 5/128 chance of being stolen, or about 4% (off of a successful steal attempt). Not all enemies have normal and rare steals, some have only one or the other.

In the case of Sand Bears, they *only* hold a Javelin in their Rare Steal slot, and have no common steal item. This means you will continue to fail quite often until you luck out with the lower percentage chance of grabbing the rare steal - the Javelin.

This isn't the case for the Sand Bear, but know for the future, enemies that have both a common item and a rare item are actually quite annoying, for this reason. You have a 123/128 chance to grab the common steal, and if you do so, you can no longer grab the rare steal. Unlike enemies that do not have a common steal, you cannot just keep trying until you are lucky. The best way to steal rare items from enemies that have both a common and rare steal is to try a steal, and then repeatedly use a time mage's "Return" ability to reset the battle until you get the rare steal.

Hopefully, that made some sense. I will mention worthwhile steals from here on out.
Getting through the desert is pretty easy, no chests.
Gohn
In Gohn, no items.
Approach the middle staircase to see King Tycoon.
Then go up the western staircase where you'll see him a second time.
Then go around and down the center staircase, where you'll see him a third time, then follow him. After a scene, you'll find yourself in a hollow underground. There are no enemies or items here, so continue on.
You'll then find yourself in the Catapult.
Catapult and Airship events
After going up a staircase, head around to the south to find a rest area to heal up. Then, push the button in the room left of the rest area. It won't work, and then you'll be put on a mini-scavenger hunt until you learn you need to pull the button instead, to find this area's three chests for the Item Collection.
Continue on the linear path, and after some scenes, you'll get the airship, and then a boss fight against Cray Claw. Use thunder.
Once you get the airship, feel free to explore a bit, but in order to continue, fly over the city of Gohn (southern side of the west continent) for a scene. Then return to Cid and Mid in the area underneath Crescent Island.
Then head to Tycoon Meteorite (NW of Crescent) to get Adamantite. Fight Adamantoise (use Blizzard). Return to Cid/Mid.
Then, get in your airship, you can now press a button to go higher into the atmosphere to find the flying ruins. You have to fight the various guns on the ruins. You can get the Blue Magics Missile and Flame Thrower here if you don't have them already.
Once all the guns are down, the big gun will appear. You can save/heal before fighting it. Use Thunder on the main gun. Cast Slow too.
You can now enter the Ronka Ruins. Stock up on Phoenix Downs beforehand. You'll want these for the Ghidra enemies.
Ronka Ruins
One-Time-Only Area Warning - Ronka Ruins

The Ronka Ruins are a one-time-only area, meaning you'll want to grab the 12 chests and all the enemy entries here before you finish.

The enemies are:

Ra Mage
Ronkan Knight
Stone Mask
Enchanted Fan
Lamia
Archaotoad
Hydra
Ghidra (in the final room, quite tough, use Phoenix Down to kill)
Blue Magic Note

White Wind - From Enchanted Fan, must be Controlled by Beastmaster
1000 Needles - From Lamia, must be Controlled by Beastmaster
Level 4 Graviga - From Ghidra in the final area on the ruins. Your level must be divisible by 4. Use Phoenix Down to kill him if you need EXP (might miss, but he's undead, so it'll work eventually), otherwise use Missile to weaken him to force the attack. He has Reflect.
Ronka Ruins Walkthrough
You want to have someone with the Thief skill Find Passages equipped for this dungeon.
Go along the initial path, grabbing the chest with a Golden Armor along the way.
In the next area, you'll have a chest with an elixir and if you check your map, there are three paths you can take. The center path simply leads to a save point to Save/Heal. 
Go along the right-most path to find a Phoenix down and ultimately a Golden Shield. Return to the three-path fork and take the left-most path to continue.
Along the left-most path, you'll eventually find a Hi-Potion. After this, you'll see a fork where you have to choose between a door to the south or a staircase to the north. Take the staircase to find a treasure room.
The Treasure Room has five chests, but there are traps on the floor that send you back a few rooms. A Geomancer's Find Pits ability can help. Hug the left and then north walls to get all the chests.
Now go through the door south of the staircase. You'll eventually find another door/staircase fork. The staircase leads to another save point. The door continues on.
You'll eventually run into one last door/staircase fork. Take the staircase to reach the two last chests, which should finish the Item Collection for this area.
Ghidra is a tough random encounter in the room with the boss.
Double-check your item collection to make sure you have all 12 chests and have defeated all the above-listed enemies for you to face the boss. 
After a bunch of scenes, you'll be left with three people. Go to the area underneath Crescent and back to the resting room in the Catapult to find a note from Cid/Mid. Then go to Tycoon Meteorite.
Meteorite World Tour, and Final Check Before World 2
You'll need to visit the other meteorites:
Walse Meteorite - Fight Purobolos x6. They'll revive themselves when killed, so its best to kill all at once. I strongly recommend having multiple Ninjas and having everyone throw scrolls as fast as possible. Seriously.
Karnak Meteorite - Fight Titan
Gohn Meteorite - fight Chimera Brain (absorbs blizzard)
At this point, you will be able to head to World 2, Galuf's World, by heading to the portal at the center of the world map. This is a good point to double-check your bestiary, blue magic, and other collections before moving on.
World 1 Final Collection Check

Before you go to Galuf's World, you should have Bestiary entries 1-69, 191-196, 229-253. You should also have played 5 pianos, have 21 Blue Magics, Shiva Summon, Romeo's Ballad, Alluring Air, Javelin, Iron Shield, Kenpo Gi.
