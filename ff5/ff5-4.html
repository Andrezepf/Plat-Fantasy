            <h1>8. A Merged World</h1>
            <hr>
<h2>Merged World Interlude</h2>
<li>Head into Castle Tycoon and go straight north for events.</li>
<li>Head S and W (with only Bartz and Krile) to the Cave to meet Boko (and Koko)</li>
<li>Now on Boko, head N of Castle Tycoon and then West of Tule to a path. You'll fall down a hole and fight Antlion.</li>
<li>After events, Faris rejoins, head west to Ghido's Cave. More events.</li>
<li>Then, head south to the Library of Ancients. More events.</li>
<li>Talk to a scholar on the roof to learn <b>Mana's Paean (missable!)</b></li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Item Note</h3>
    
    Get <u>Mana's Paean</u> from a scholar in the Library of Ancients before doing the Pyramid of Moore dungeon.
</div>
<li>You'll be without Lenna for a bit here.</li>
<h2>Overworld - Castle Surgate Area</h2>
<li>Some new enemies, along with some enemies you may have gotten before at the end of world 2.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Sleepy</li>
    <li>Triffid</li>
    <li>Hedgehog</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Shadow</li>
    <li>Elm Gigas</li>
</ul>
<li>Head west to the Guardian Tree for a quick scene. Then continue west to the shifting sands for another quick scene.</li>
<li>More enemies can be encountered in the desert. Ignore the pyramid in the center for now.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Desertpede</li>
    <li>Bulette</li>
</ul>
<li>And then in the area west of the desert</li>
<ul>
    <li>Slug</li>
    <li>Gloom Widow</li>
    <li>Mykale</li>
</ul>
<li>Stop by Moore to pick up the Brave Blade or Chicken Knife. Go around the pub and through a secret path in the trees to the south. The left crate is the Brave Blade, right is the Chicken Knife.</li>
<ul><li>These don't seem to count for Item Collection.</li></ul>
<li>When ready, head to the Pyramid of Moore in the desert.</li>
<h2>Pyramid of Moore Dungeon</h2>
<li>A long dungeon with several chests.</li>
<li>Make sure you got Mana's Paean before doing this dungeon.</li>
<li>Old Enemies</li>
<ul>
    <li>Objet d'Art (monster-in-a-box)</li>
    <li>Black Warlock (chance in a chest)</li>
    <p>Bandercoeurl</p>
</ul>
<li>New Enemies</li>
<ul>
    <li>Lamia Queen</li>
    <li>Ushtabi</li>
    <li>Archeosaur</li>
    <li>Zephyrus</li>
    <li>Rajiformes</li>
    <li>Mummy</li>
    <li>Apsis</li>
    <li>Mecha Head</li>
    <li>The Damned</li>
    <li>Grand Mummy</li>
    <li>Sekmet (one time only, can steal another pair of Thieve's Gloves)</li>
    <li>Steel Fist (monster-in-a-box)</li>
    <li>Gargoyle (a semi-boss you'll fight several times)</li>
</ul>
<li>You first fight two Gargoyles. They revive each other. Go inside.</li>
<li>Take the left-most path. Float over the spikes, or press left then right buttons. Get swept by the sand.</li>
<li>Grab the chest (monster box), then go north (fight the Apsis). Continue along the path, you can turn off the sand river you encountered earlier, then go to floor 2.</li>
<li>Go through some hidden paths to the next stairs, open the sarcophagus, get Cursed Ring from inside (good stats, but auto-Doom).</li>
<li>Return to the beginning of the dungeon (use Teleport) and go through the door you skipped before in the first room. 2F has a simple button puzzle and more Apsis.</li>
<li>3F has three chests, all monster-in-a-box.</li>
<li>4F will have Mecha Heads and Apsis roaming around, both very beatable. Press a button to the west, and go past the spikes to fight Archeosaur and get Black Robe. Then go to the NE side of the room to open two chests and another sarcophagus. The Thornlet item you'll get has auto-Sap. Then head to the next floor. There is a save point (save, heal).</li>
<li>On 5F you may encounter Sekhmet, who can only be killed once. You can steal extra Thieve's Gloves from him if you want. Go up the north stairs for two chests (monster-in-a-box). Then get a chest back o 5F to the east. The last chest to the NE you cannot get yet.</li>
<li>On 6F, don't press the button. Run into the sand to get the chest you just passed up. Then return and press the button. Continue to the room to the NE and press the *left* button to get to four chests. Then continue to 7F.</li>
<li>On 7F, ignore the staircase and go through the western door to reach 4 chests. Then use the center stairs.</li>
<li>On 8F, the floor will change every few seconds to a different layout. Be patient and use the tiles that do not change to carefully move over the changing tiles in order to grab the three chests. Then go to the NE stairs to get two more chests. Then return and go to the NW stairs to grab two more chests.</li>
<li>This should be all 28 chests for your item collection.</li>
<li>Continue to the end of the dungeon for some scenes.</li>
<h2>Getting an Airship for some sidequesting</h2>
<li>After leaving, make sure to save.</li>

<li>Go east to the Guardian Tree for cutscenes and a boss fight - Melusine.</li>
<li>Lenna will rejoin after.</li>
<li>Then, head to the ship to the NE of Castle Surgate for more scenes. Now you have an airship.</li>
<li>Dont fly above the void holes, specifically the one where Castle Tycoon was.</li>
<li>Go to Regole (use your map to find), talk to the girl in between the counters for a Ribbon.</li>
<li>Go to Carwen and speak with the green-haired woman south of the pub and click 'yes' for a short scene with an impersonator. More on him later.</li>
<li>Go to Crescent (no longer an island) and play the Piano. If you have played the 7 pianos thus far, you'll learn <b>Sinewy Etude</b> from the bard here.</li>
<li>Go to the Pirate Hideout to learn the <b>Syldra</b> Summon.</li>
<li>Go to Kuza Sealed Castle and get three of the legendary weapons. You'll get 3 weapons per tablet you find. You can also fight <b>Exdeath's Soul</b> here now, a regular enemy encounter.</li>
G<li>o back through Jachol Cave to fight <b>Odin</b> and get his summon. Can rare steal a <b>Protect Ring</b>.</li>
<div id="box"><b>Item Note:</b> A commenter states I missed an item in Carwen in the merged world. "Cottage, on the NE dock area after the guy moves out of the way"</div>
<h2>Phantom Village</h2>
<li>Fly to the town of the Crescent, and fly south from there. Go to the third forest from the town and land. Walk around and you'll enter the Phantom Village.</li>
<li>Each shop has a front-facing shopkeep and a hidden one.</li>
<li>Armor Shop has a crate you can click to get to the other shop.</li>
<li>A hidden side entrance to the magic shop will have new magic.</li>
<li>A hidden back entrance to the pub gives leads to the area's hidden item in a barrel <b>(Thief's Knife)</b></li>
<li>The guy down the stairs wants you to run around the world on Boko. This is easy, just takes some time. He'll give you a <b>Mirage Vest</b> for doing so.</li>
<li>You'll find the last piano (8/8) soon after.</li>
<li>After this, you can find the other weapon shop, the last piano, and a black chocobo you'll need for a quest later.</li>
<h2>More Airship Exploration</h2>
<li>Here are some new world map-only enemies that you won't find anywhere else.</li>
<li>West of Regole</li>
<ul>
    <li>Frost Bull</li>
    <li>Istory Lythos (can rare steal Judgment Staff, a powerful rare staff)</li>
    <li>Spizzner</li>
</ul>
<li>Lake near Crescent</li>
<ul>
    <li>Rukh</li>
    <li>Sea Devil</li>
    <li>For item collectors, you can rare steal from Rukh's for a Murasame (otherwise only obtainable from a rare boss drop). Can rare steal from Sea Devils for Defender (you'll get one of these in a chest later).</li>
</ul>
<li>SW corner of map sea area</li>
<ul>
    <li>Vilia</li>
    <li>Gel Fish</li>
</ul>
<li>North and outer ocean</li>

<li>Eastern inner Sea</li>
<ul>
    <li>Nix</li>
    <li>Corbett (if you never killed before)</li>
    <li>Stingray (rare)</li>
</ul>
<li>You can fight Stingray, a rare encounter in the inner sea on the east side of the map, to get Blue Magic <b>Mighty Guard</b> (use Control), and get rare drop <b>Dragon Whisker</b>. You can technically get a Dragon Whisker as a rare steal from superboss Shinryu later, but it's easier to get here.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Mighty Guard</b> - From Stingray in the eastern inner sea. Use Control. He is a rare encounter.</p>
</div>
<li>After this, go to Crescent to play the piano in the SE house to get <b>Hero's Rime</b> from the bard for having 8/8 pianos.</li>
<li>Then, use Boko to go to the waterfall in the river/mountain area in the NW part of the world map. Examine the center part of the waterfall to find the <b>Magic Lamp</b>.</li>
<h2>Island Shrine Dungeon</h2>
<li>After all the optional stuff, go to the Island Shrine in the South part of the center ocean area. It's useful to have Find Passages and Find Pits.</li>
<li>This dungeon is not one time only. 14 chests with these enemies.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Prototype</li>
    <li>Mecha Head</li>
    <li>The Damned</li>
    <li>Executor</li>
    <li>Oiseaurare</li>
    <li>Shadow Dancer</li>

    <li>Gargoyle</li>
</ul>
<li>Island Shrine Quick Walkthrough</li>
<ul>
    <li>Fight Gargoyles and enter the door</li>
    <li>Grab the chest and continue</li>
    <li>Head into the vent. The room it drops you in has two switches AND two hidden chests, one in the SE corner and one in the SW corner, just one tile up from the corner itself.</li>
</ul>
<li>Flip levers both down to have the vent lead to a chest</li>
<li>Flip levers Up | Down to have the cent lead to another chest</li>
<li>Flip levels Down | Up to proceed.</li>
<li>The rest of the level is straightforward. use the map to find chests and hidden paths.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Mind Blast</b> - From Wendigo boss in Island Shrine</p>
</div>
<li>Get the tablet at the end, fight Wendigo (get blue magic Mind Blast). Teleport out.</li>
<li>Go to Kuza Sealed Castle again to get three more Sealed Weapons.</li>
<h2>Fork Tower</h2>
<div id="box">
    <h3>One-Time-Only Dungeon Warning - Fork Tower</h3>
    
    <p>Fork Tower is a one-time-only dungeon, meaning you'll want to get all 4 chests and all enemies before you complete it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fork Tower is also a little weird, as you split up into two groups to complete it. When you first enter the tower, check your in-game map. It'll tell you there are 4 chests. As soon as you split up, though, the two split maps tell you there are 0 chests, for some reason. Pretty strange.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Make sure to get these enemies and chests (bolded are new missables).</p>
</div>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Left (Magic) side</h3>
    <p>Tiny Mage (MISSABLE)</p>
    <p>Chrono Controller (MISSABLE)</p>
    <p>Flare Mancer (MISSABLE, can steal Blitz Whip)</p>
    <p>Mani Wizard (if you never got before)</p>
    <p>Ricard Mage (supposedly, I've never met one, but you should have gotten a long time ago)</p>
    <p>Two chests on the way up (4F and 7F)</p>
    <p>Boss - Minotaur. You can steal a Fuma Shuriken but nothing special.</p>
</div>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Right (Physical) side</h3>
    <p>Dueling Knight (MISSABLE)</p>
    <p>Iron Muscles (MISSABLE)</p>
    <p>Berserker (MISSABLE, can drop Death Sickle)</p>
    <p>Bandersnatch (supposedly, I've never met one, but you should have gotten a long time ago)</p>
    <p>Two chests on the way up (4F and 7F)</p>
    <p>Boss - Omniscient. The rare steal is a second Kornago Gourd and the only other one you can get, but not really worth it. Carbuncle helps a lot.</p>
</div>
<h2>Underwater Exploration</h2>
<li>Go to the catapult under Crescent now, and find Cid. After the scenes, you have a submarine.</li>
<li>Go underwater and use your World Map item from your inventory to see 4 dots in the submerged section of the world.</li>
<li>The NW Cave you've already been to back on World 2.</li>
<li>The Center spot is Mr. Clio, an NPC who gives you stats about the game. Make sure to enter this area at least once for achievement purposes.</li> 
<li>The NE spot is the Tower of Walse submerged. Go here. Run to the end (enemies aren't in the bestiary). Against Gogo, simply wait about two minutes <b>doing nothing</b>. You'll gain Mimic Job.</li>
<li>Then, go to The Great Sea Trench, the center-east dot on the underwater world map.</li> 
<h2>The Great Sea Trench</h2>

<li>Besides the usual Gargoyles, the enemies here are all called 'Unknown'.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Unknown (#168) - Rare</li>
    <li>Unknown (#169)</li>
    <li>Unknown (#170)</li>
    <li>Unknown (#171)</li>
    <li>Unknown (#172)</li>
    <li>Gargoyle</li>
</ul>
<li>Note: Unknown #168 and Unknown #171 look identical to each other. #168 is a rare spawn. Make sure you get both types, though neither are missable.</li>
<li>This dungeon is mostly linear.</li>
<ul>
    <li>B2F - simply grab the chest and continue</li>
    <li>B3F - just a save point</li>
    <li>B4F - This path is linear. In the second room on this floor, click the NE skull to get to the chest with a Flame Ring.</li>
    <li>B5F  - Use Float and go to the next floor</li>
    <li>B6F - Two chests and go to the next area</li>
    <li>B7F - A mini dwarf kingdom. Buy stuff if you need it and head south. In the underwater lake, head to an alcove in the SE to charge the Magic Lamp.</li>
    <li>B8F- Skip the chest in the center for now. Click the easternmost skull to get the last chest in the dungeon to complete your Item Collection. Then click each of the three skulls in the SW once each, then click the center chest you skipped before.</li>
    <li>Fight the triple boss for the third tablet. Break Spellblade works well.</li>
</ul>
<li>You can get three more sealed weapons from Kuza, The Sealed Castle.</li>
<h2>Istory Falls</h2>
<li>To head to Istory Falls, you have to head through the Cave in the underwater NW first.</li>
<li>The cave itself is the same as before in World 2. Continue to the falls themselves.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Mercury Bat</li>
    <li>Coral</li>
    <li>Aquagel</li>
    <li>Steel Fist</li>
    <li>Alchymia (may be accompanied by a ??? which she'll transform into a different monster)</li>
    <li>Tonberry (can drop Mirage Vest)</li>
    <li>Gargoyle</li>
</ul>
<li>This dungeon is linear. Even in the one room that looks like a fork, both branches just lead to the same room anyway. Use Find Passages and Find Pits to get all the chests. Look at your map too of course.</li>
<li>At the end, fight Leviathan and get Leviathan summon.</li>
<li>Get the last three sealed weapons from Kuza, The Sealed Castle.</li>
<h1>9. The Final Stretch</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Final Sidequests</h2>
<li>Use the black chocobo you got from the Phantom Village to fly to the big desert in the NE corner of the map.</li>
<li>A few final world map enemies here</li>
<ul>
    <li>Ankheg</li>
    <li>Ammonite</li>
    <li>Landcrawler (check SE section of the desert, can you Death magic to kill)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phoenix Tower</h2>
<li>Enter the Phoenix Tower on the south side of the desert</li>
<ul>
    <li>Lemure</li>
    <li>Parthenope</li>
    <li>Cherie</li>
</ul>
<li>Phoenix Tower is a 30-floor tower. Most floors have two exits, one that is trapped and one that is not. The trapped exits will simply lead to a winnable fight.</li>
<li>Every 5 floors you'll see two pots. Both have an item to collect, but one of each pair is a <b>Magic Pot</b> enemy. Don't try to fight it. Instead, just throw it an Elixir.</li>
<li>At the top, you'll get Phoenix.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Roulette</b> - From Parthenope in Phoenix Tower. If you've gotten all the other Blue Magic listed in this guide, this should be the last one. Else, check out the <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11955-final-fantasy-v-blue-magic-how-to-learn-every-spell-for-the-blue-mage" target="_blank">Final Fantasy V Blue Magic Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>North Mountain</h2>
<li>Now go to the NE side of the desert to enter North Mountain again.</li>
<li>Simply head through the linear path to fight Bahamut. Flare spellblade + rapid-fire combo works here well.</li>
<li>You'll earn <b>Bahamut</b> as a summon.</li>
<h1>10. The Interdimensional Rift</h1>
<hr>
<li>This is the final dungeon in the game. None of the enemies or chests here are missable from this point out. Only some stealable items from bosses are unique, which I will mention.</li>
<li>For fuller strategies on bosses in this area, check out the <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11940-final-fantasy-v-boss-guide-every-boss-and-how-to-beat-them" target="_blank">Final Fantasy V Boss Guide</a>.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Desert</h2>
<li>No new enemies or chests here. Simply continue to the next section.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Ruins</h2>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Grenade</li>
    <li>Baldanders</li>
    <li>Death Dealer</li>
</ul>
<li>The path is pretty linear, leading to 6 chests (6/22 for the area)</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Phantom Village</h2>
<li>No new enemies or chests here. Simply continue to the next section.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Forest</h2>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>White Flame</li>
    <li>Moss Fungus</li>
    <li>Farfarello</li>
</ul>
<li>Use your map to find 4 more chests (10/22 for the area).</li>
<li>Boss - Calofisteri. Nothing special, nothing worth stealing. Poison works.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Cave</h2>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Orukat</li>
    <li>Great Dragon</li>
    <li>Achelon</li>
</ul>
<li>Use your map to find entrances between waterfalls. Walk into a waterfall to find a chest with an Angel Ring (11/22).</li>
<li>Then continue on the linear path to find another chest with a Coral Ring (12/22)</li>
<li>Optional Boss - <b>Omega</b>. This is one of the game's superbosses. Thundaga Spellblade + Rapidfire works. Nothing worth stealing.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Library</h2>
<li>No chests or random encounters here. Examine the book on the table to fight Apanda. Nothing with stealing. Weak to Fire.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - The Tower</h2>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Ninja</li>
    <li>Dragon Aevis</li>
</ul>
<li>This is a linear path with no chests. Use Find Passages. No boss!</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - Dimension Castle</h2>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Sword Dancer</li>
    <li>Death Claw</li>
    <li>Fury</li>
    <li>Yojimbo</li>
    <li>Iron Giant (top inner floor of the castle)</li>
</ul>
<li>You will fight a lot of bosses in this section, be aware.</li>
<li>Go the western side hall and follow the southern path to a chest with Thor Hammer (13/22)</li>
<li>Do the same on the eastern side hall for a Hermes Sandals (14/22)</li>
<li>Use the staircase to go into the jail basement. Go ahead and fight all the old men NPCs, which are minibosses.</li>
<li>Grab two chests in the cells (16/22)</li>
<li>You can optionally fight Azulmagia in the SW cell. He has <b>Titan's Gloves</b> as his rare steal item, which is the only place in the game to get them. You can use the blue magic Self-Destruct to kill him easily.</li>
<li>On the right side of the jail, you'll fight Catastrophe.</li>
<li>Exit the jail through the right-side stairs.</li>
<li>Then ignore the central building and go to the west side of the jail to get a Man-Eater (17/22).</li>
<li>Now enter the center building. You can go down the staircase to make a shortcut for yourself.</li>
<li>You are about to fight Halicarnassus. Pro-tip, turn everyone into a Toad <b>*before*</b> fighting them, as they'll cast Ribbit on his first turn. You'll fight them after the throne.</li>
<li>After that, you'll fight Twintania. You can steal a second Titan's Axe if you want, but only when he is charging Giga Flare. Otherwise just use a Break Spellblade on him, when he is charging.</li>
<h2>Interdimensional Rift - Finale</h2>
<li>Again, keep an eye on our boss guide for some strategies.</li>
<li>New enemies here include:</li>
<ul>
    <li>King Behemoth</li>
    <li>Crystal Dragon</li>
    <li>Necromancer</li>
    <li>Gorgimera</li>
    <li>Mindflayer</li>
    <li>Crystelle</li>
    <li>Belphegor</li>
    <li>Mover</li>
</ul>
<li>This section is pretty straightforward. You will find the 5 last chests to complete the Item Collection easily (22/22 for the area). However, later on, note a chest at the bottom of a downwards staircase. This chest houses Shinryu, one of the game's superbosses. You'll get <b>Ragnarok</b> for beating him.</li>
<li>Before that though, you'll see <b>Gilgamesh</b> standing there. Fight him. He will flee very quickly, all you need to do is <b>STEAL HIS GENJI SHIELD</b> before he can.</li>
<li>Near the end, you'll see a green light you can interact with. This is yet another boss, Necrophobe.</li>
<li>To fight Necrophobe, take out his barriers and then damage him with any element. When he has 10K health left, Gilgamesh will appear one last time, only as your ally for once. As Gilgamesh and Necrophobe banter about, steal his <b>Genji Armor</b>, the last of the 4 Genji pieces.</li>
<li>All that's left to do is take out Exdeath and save the merged world!</li>
<li>Note, once you beat the game, you'll be prompted to make a clear save, which will bring you out of the dungeon as if you've completed everything up until the Final Boss encounter itself. Use this opportunity to collect anything you might have missed at this point.</li>
<p>With Exdeath taken down, enjoy the credits!</p>           
        </ul>
