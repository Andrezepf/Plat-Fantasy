            <hr>
<li><b>Fight a Pao (missable!)</b>, then the game will prompt you to use a tent when you enter the forest. Then you fight a solo boss Abductor. In some versions of Final Fantasy V, this bestiary entry is missable if you lose. So, make sure you win.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Bestiary Note</h3>
    
    In some versions of Final Fantasy V, the Abductor you fight as Bartz solo is missable if you lose. So, make sure you win.
</div>
<h2>Castle Exdeath</h2>
<li>You end up in Castle Exdeath. After some scenes, once you regain control of Galuf alone, head north into the door and save. The next north door has a healing point.</li>
<li>Head down the single path, you'll fight Gilgamesh alone with Galuf. Blue Magic like Missile or Death Claw will help a lot. You'll free Bartz, Lenna, and Faris. Then leave.</li>

<li>Enemies in Castle Exdeath's basement. These enemies are *eventually* missable, but won't leave for a while. Get them now though.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Tarantula</li>
    <li>Shell Bear (the only place to steal Spears)</li>
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Enemy and Item Note</h3>
    
    <u>Tarantula</u> and <u>Shell Bear</u> in the Castle Exdeath are <b>missable</b>. Also, Shell Bears are the only place you can steal <u>Spears</u>, for some reason, so get one if you want.
</div>
<li>Your map will say there are 15 items in Exdeath's Castle. You will get these much later.</li>
<h2>Castle Exdeath Area</h2>
<li>You'll want to escape over the Big Bridge to the west, but get the nearby enemies added to your bestiary first.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Devilfish</li>
    <li>Treant (forest)</li>
    <li>Strapparer (somewhat rare, has <b>Dark Spark</b> and <b>Death Claw</b> if you don't have these Blue Magic yet)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Big Bridge</h2>
<li>You'll proceed along the bridge. The enemy encounters here are not really random, and instead, happen on certain tiles, but the encountered enemies themselves are somewhat random. These four enemies are also missable, so make sure you get them.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Merrow</li>
    <li>Flying Killer</li>
    <li>Little Chariot</li>
    <li>Neo Garula</li>
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Enemies Note</h3>
    
    <u>Merrow</u>, <u>Flying Killer</u>, <u>Little Chariot</u>, and <u>Neo Garula</u> are <b>missable</b> enemies on the Big Bridge.
</div>
<li>You'll fight Gilgamesh again halfway down the bridge. He doesn't have anything super valuable worth stealing yet (Genji equipment comes later).</li>
<li>After the bridge, you get blown away to a different region near Regole.</li>
<h2>Regole (and surrounding area)</h2>
<li>First of all, there are a handful of new enemies you can find in the area around Regole.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Tunneler (forest)</li>
    <li>Birostris (forest)</li>
    <li>Fairy Orc</li>
    <li>Devourer (swamp)</li>
    <li>Mandrake (swamp)</li>
</ul>
<li>In the city itself, use the Inn (free) for a scene.</li>
<li>Go to the pub and head through a secret passage on the west wall for a piano (6/8)</li>
<li>Bunch of stuff to buy.</li>
<h2>Kuza, The Sealed Castle</h2>
<li>You now want to head to the south on the world map. You'll pass a castle area. This is <b>Kuza, the Sealed Castle</b>, a location that will be more important later. A couple of notable and strong enemies here:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Kuza Beast</li>
    <li>Shield Dragon</li>
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Enemy Note</h3>
    
    Make sure to encounter <b>Kuza Beast</b> before you head to World 3.
</div>
 <li>You can fight a random but somewhat rare enemy called a Kuza Beast near the castle (for example, on the bridge). It has 5000 HP and is pretty tough, but make sure you encounter it.</li>
<li>Inside the castle, you can fight <b>Shield Dragon</b>. It's very tough at this point. The best way to kill him is to control with a Beastmaster and use Blaze on himself over and over.</li>
<li>Keep going along the world and you'll run into the Moogle forest. Follow to the Underground Waterway.</li>
<h2>Underground Waterway.</h2>
<div id="box">
    <h3>One-Time-Only Area Warning - Underground Waterway</h3> 
    <p>This dungeon has missable chests and enemies. Two chests are easy to get using your map. The four missable enemies here are:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Blood Slime</p>
    <p>Acrophies</p>
    <p>Moogle Eater</p>
    <p>Lesser Lopros (somewhat rare)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: some sources say this area isn't actually missable, but no harm in getting them now anyway, right?</p>
</div>
<li>Otherwise, the waterway dungeon is pretty straightforward. Two chests to get along the way. Boss Tyrannosaur is undead and weak to fire (can use Phoenix Down). Follow the Moogle out the other side.</li>
<h2>Moogle Village Area</h2>
<li>This area of the world map mostly has the same enemies as the Regole area, but there are two new enemies in the desert.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Cactus</li>
    <li>Sandcrawler (Somewhat tough with 15K HP, use spellblade level 5 Break to win instantly.)</li>
</ul>
<li>Head all the way to the North to a large forest surrounded by mountains. The moogle village is hidden in the center.</li>
<li>Here, talk to the moogle on the east side of the village and collect the six chests here.</li>
<li>Then go to the center home to get a moogle suit, then go to the building to the left and talk to the moogle to get the last item in the village, then talk to the moogle on the far right of the village again.</li>
<li>After some scenes, you'll be at the Castle of Bal.</li>
<h2>Castle of Bal</h2>
<li>After the scenes, you can get two chests to the SW of the throne, one of those hidden in a small passage. Then, leave and head out to the courtyard.</li>
<li>There are two doors in the courtyard, both leading to shops. The only new item is a Gauntlet in the armor shop.</li>
<li>Go up the stairs in the weapon/armor shop, then you can head downstairs obscured by the tower. Here, get the last chest, and then press the button to the S wall, and stand between the shop keepers. You'll get a <b>Lamia Harp</b>.</li>
<li>For the last item, go to the SW of the courtyard and you can end up in the surrounding moat. Head ALL the way around the moat to get a <b>Great Sword</b>, finishing the Item Collection here.</li> 
<div id="box">
    <h3>AP Grinding Spot Note</h3>
    
    <p>If you head back to the main building and head downstairs, you can fight Objet D'Arts. These guys are weak to Level 5 Death, so they are easy to kill and give great AP. Grind a bit if you want.</p>
</div>
<li>To continue, go back to the main building and ascend the stairs to talk with Krile and Wind Drake for a scene.</li>
<li>Leave the town to fight an Abductor. You won't be able to return for a while.</li>
<h1>6. Drakes and Moore</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Bal Region</h2>
<li>As usual, let's first look at the new enemies in the region around Bal.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Aquathorn</li>
    <li>Weresnake</li>
    <li>Kornago</li>
    <li>Cursed Being</li>
</ul>
<li>If you want a cool Beastmaster item later, catch a Kornago. The easiest way to do this is to use the Blue Magic Death Claw.</li>
<p>Go north to the village of Quelb.</p>
<h2>Quelb</h2>
<li>Check out the north gate, which is locked</li>
<li>Enter the topmost house for some scenes</li>
<li>Check out shops for stuff</li>
<li>Examine the well to the SW. Give the old man the Kornago you caught and 10K gold for a Kornago Gourd, which makes catching easier.</li>
<li>Talk to a werewolf in the NE for a Requiem song for bards</li>
<li>Leave and head north to Drakenvale.</li>
<h2>Drakenvale</h2>
<li>Drakenvale is a very linear dungeon. You easily be able to find the chests along the way.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Drippy</li>
    <li>Lycaon</li>
    <li>Bone Dragon</li>
    <li>Poison Eagle</li>
    <li>Zombie Dragon</li>
</ul>
<li>On the screen with scattered bones, check under one of the skulls for a Bone Mail.</li>
<li>On the same screen, you will run into Golem. The first time he'll be labeled as ??? and run away. The second time, he'll be attacked by a Bone Dragon and Zombie Dragon. Kill them and you'll get the Golem summon item (don't toss it). You'll also add Golem to your bestiary.</li>
<li>Dragon Pod boss - Monk's Kick skill is useful.</li>
<h2>Return to Bal Castle, Castle Surgate</h2>
<li>Return to Bal Castle and talk to Krile in bed. Then talk to the Wind Drake. Then fly north of the opening near Drakenvale to an island cave. It'll sink. Then fly west to Castle Surgate.</li>
<li>After some scenes, head up the NW stairs and follow the path to a library. Head to the next floor of the library and put the three books back on the shelves in the proper place (simply alphabetical). Then talk to the NPC, who will open a new path.</li>
<li>Go into the new room and open a chest, then go outside.</li>
<li>Go west across this courtyard to another room with another chest. Return to the throne room.</li>
<li>Head to the SW stair in the throne room to enter Xezat's room. Read the book for <b>Swift Song</b>.</li>
<li>Use the last staircase in the throne room to enter shops. The weapon shop has new stuff.</li>
<li>When ready, fly east of Exdeath's castle to find Xezat's fleet. Make sure you have a thief with Thief's Gloves.</li>
<h2>Attack on Barrier Tower</h2>
<li>Here you'll fight some Gobbledygooks.</li>
<li>This you'll fight Gilgamesh the third time. <b>STEAL HIS GENJI GLOVES</b>. Enkidu shows up too.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missable Item Note</h3>
    
    <p>Steal Gilgamesh's <u>Genji Gloves</u> when you fight him on the Surgate boat. It is his common steal, so it should be easy.</p>
</div> 
<li>Then go below deck and talk to Xezat. After some scenes, you'll now be in Barrier Tower.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>One-Time-Only Dungeon Warning - Barrier Tower</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Barrier Tower is a one-time-only dungeon, meaning the 4 chests and many enemies here need to be obtained here or missed forever.</p>
    
    <p>The enemies you need to get here are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Neon</li>
        <li>Magnetite</li>
        <li>Reflect Knight</li>
        <li>Traveler</li>
        <li>Level Tricker</li>
        <li>Gravitator</li>
        <li>Ziggurat Gigas (last floor near second save point)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Time Slip</b> - From Traveler</p>
    <p><b>Level 2 Old</b> - From Level Tricker</p>
    <p>Use Chemist's Mix ability Dragon Defense (Phoenix Down+Dragon Fang) to cast Reflect on the enemy. Then control it with a Beastmaster. Use Level 2 Old on the Level Tricker itself, which will bounce the spell onto a single randomly targeted party member. The learner must be a level divisible by 2.</p>
    <p><b>Level 3 Flare</b> - From Red Dragon in a monster-box</p>
    <p>Use Chemist's Mix ability Dragon Defense (Phoenix Down+Dragon Fang) to cast Reflect on the enemy. Then control it with a Beastmaster. Use Level 3 Flare on the Red Dragon itself, which will bounce the spell onto a single randomly targeted party member. The learner must be on level divisible by 3.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: Of the four chests in Barrier Tower, two of them are monsters-in-a-box. These can be either Red Dragon or Yellow Dragon (it's random). Both enemies can be encountered layer, so don't worry too much if you don't encounter them now or get Level 3 Flare.</p>
</div>
<li>The dungeon is very linear, but getting the enemies and Blue Magic might take a bit.</li>
<li>Boss Atomos can be sleeped with a Sleep spellblade.</li>
<li>After the boss, scenes, take the submarine to a thin crevasse in the SW of the western continent, then surface. You'll be near the town of Moore.</li>
<h2>Moore Area</h2>
<li>Before entering Moore, find these enemies nearby</li>
<ul>
    <li>Cure Beast</li>
    <li>Land Turtle</li>
    <li>Dechirer</li>
</ul>
<li>In the city, find a piano in the pub (7/8)</li>
<li>Main Gauche is in barrel outside the pub as the lone hidden item.</li>
<li>Lots of good stuff to buy.</li>
<h2>Sea Floor Exploration</h2>
<li>When ready, use the submarine to go to a cave in the underwater NW area. The cave has two enemies:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Ironback</li>
    <li>Druid</li>
</ul>
<li>On the overworld on the other side of the cave, find Catoblepas in the forest. Beat him up to get his summon. Don't throw away his item. This is <b>missable!</b>.</li>
<li>Make sure you enter Chocobo Forest here. It is one of the few optional locations in the get for achievement purposes, and it is <b>missable</b>.</li>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Missables Note</h3>
    
    <p>Fight <u>Catoblepas</u> after the Sea Floor Cave before heading to the 3rd world.</p>
    <p>Enter the <u>Chocobo Forest near Catoblepas</u> before heading to the 3rd world.</p>
</div>
<li>Then go to Ghido's cave, at the center of the map, where the island was before it sank. Two enemies here:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Dark Aspic</li>
    <li>Metamorph</li>
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Aeroga</b> - from Metamorph's Enchanted Fan form in Ghido's Cave</p>
    <br>
    <p>Metamorph transforms into other enemies.</p>
    <p>There are four possible encounters with Metamorph, each having three different monsters it will randomly transform into. The four encounter variations are:</p>
    <br>
    <p>-Shiva, Gaelicat, Elf Toad</p>
    <p>-Ifrit, Wyvern, Enchanted Fan</p>
    <p>-Ramuh, Crew Dust, Zombie Dragon</p>
    <p>-Shiva, Ifrit, Ramuh</p>
</div>
<li>The cave itself is quite simple. Continue until you get a stone from a chest.</li>
<li>Place the stone in the NW chest to press a switch.</li>
<li>Then place the stone in the SW chest to continue.</li>
<li>Use Find Passages to make your way through hidden passages.</li>
<li>Talk to Ghido, get a key item. Teleport out.</li>
<li>Now go to Great Forest of Moore.</li>
<h2>The Great Forest of Moore</h2>
<li>This dungeon is trivialized by using your in-game map. It's very easy to get all the chests this way. Go through the holes in trees to continue.</li> 
<li>Here are the enemies:</li>
<ul>
    Mini Magician
    Galajelly
    Mammon
    Imp
    Wyrm (this enemy is reportedly missable and will no longer show up after the fire)
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p><b>Lilliputian Lyric</b> - From Mini Magician in Forest of Moore.</p>
</div>
<li>A quick note about one of the chests: The chest near the Moogle that appears can change depending on if you pick it up before or after the fire. Before is Aegis Shield, after is Flame Shield. The Flame Shield is better, and you'll get at least one of each of these items later anyway.</li>
<li>Boss is 4 crystals, each with a different elemental absorption. Graviga and Missile can help a lot.</li>
<li>A bunch of scenes happen here.</li> 

<h2>7. Wrapping Up Galuf's World</h2>
<h3>Gil Cave</h3>
<li>Restock and when ready, head to a cave near Bal. This is Gil Cave.</li>
<li>This is an optional location, but you can meet two enemies here:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Undergrounder</li>
    <li>Gil Turtle</li>
</ul>
<li>The Gil Turtle is a boss-like enemy that you can meet multiple times. He is weak to Blizzard. You want to attack him with one person at a time, as he will counter. Use Blizzaga/Spellblade/Shiva and heal/revive when needed. Also, use float.</li>
<li>The Gil Cave has a section behind a door where Bartz will pick up money on each tile, with the amount increasing exponentially as he traverses the path. You may fight the Gil Turtle on any one of these tiles. Consider abusing quicksaves if you want to collect some money but not take on Gil Turtle too many times.</li>
<h2>Some random World Map enemies</h2>
<li>Some random enemies to get. Go to the forest on SE islands. You can get these later, but why not now?</li>
<ul>
    <li>Sleepy</li>
    <li>Triffid</li>
    <li>Hedgehog (A commenter notes that this monster can be rare at this point and is more easily obtained in the Merged World).</li>
    <li>Shadow</li>
</ul>
<p>Now's a good time to fight <b>Kuza Beast</b> if you haven't already, who is missable, outside the Sealed Castle. You can also fight <b>Shield Dragon</b> inside, although this is not missable.</p>
<li>Now we go to Exdeath's Castle, for real this time.</li>
<h2>Castle Exdeath</h2>
<div id="box">
    <h3>One-Time-Only Dungeon Warning - Castle Exdeath</h3>
    
    <p>Castle Exdeath will disappear once you defeat the boss here. So, you'll want to fight all enemies here and get all 15 chests. As usual, remember that you'll no longer be able to chest your item collection after you finish the dungeon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are a lot of enemies here:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Twin Lizard</p>
    <p>Blind Wolf</p>
    <p>Hellraiser</p>
    <p>Reflect Mage</p>
    <p>Magic Dragon (Has Blue Magic <b>Aeroga</b> if you didn't get it from Metamorph)</p>
    <p>Black Warlock (Only enemy in the game to drop <b>Power Staff</b>. Can also rare steal Judgment Staff, though this is also available later)</p>
    <p>Adamantite Golem</p>
    <p>Bandercoeurl</p>
    <p>Iron Fist</p>
    <p>Blue Dragon</p>
    <p>Red Dragon (Can get <b>Level 3 Flare</b> here if you didn't get it from a chest battle in Barrier Tower)</p>
    <p>Yellow Dragon</p>
    <br>
<p>A forewarning, you'll also fight Gilgamesh again partway through the dungeon, which is the only time you can steal <b>Genji Helm</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>One last missable - <b>Carbuncle</b> can be fought and gained for summoners in Castle Exdeath, so don't miss him.</p>
</div>
<li>Castle Exdeath Quick Walkthrough</li>
<ul>
    <li>2F - Two chests</li>
    <li>3F - Enter the west room, then try to leave for a scene</li>
    <li>4F - Flip the switch, one chest</li>
    <li>5F - One chest</li>
    <li>6F - Two chests, one in a hidden path in the lava</li>
    <li>7F - A semi-rare enemy (but not missable) can be found here - <b>Oiseaurare</b>. Make the bridge end on the second wall from the left, which can get the monster to spawn. Two chests.</li>
    <li>8F - Two chests</li>
    <li>9F - The first time you enter this screen it'll just be a staircase, head up to 10F.</li>
    <li>10F - Head back down to 9F.</li>
    <li>9F - Cast Float, go up the far east staircase to a chest on 10F, then return and go up the other staircase available to you.</li>
    <li>10F - In the skull diamond area, grab the chest, then go to the N-most square to warp to <b>Carbuncle (MISSABLE)</b>. Then return to this diamond and head S.</li>
    <li>11F - Before opening the chest in the center, go up the East staircase and collect two chests. Then return, open the empty chest, fight Gilgamesh. <b>STEAL HIS GENJI HELM.</b> That should be all 15 chests, finishing your item collection.</li>
</ul>
<div id="box">
    <h3>World 2 Final Collection Check</h3>
    
    <p>After getting all the items and bestiary entries in Castle Exdeath, but before taking on Exdeath himself, you should have bestiary entries 1-137, 139,  176-177, 191-196, 229-273. You should also have <b>Catoblepas</b>, <b>Carbuncle</b>, <b>Golem</b> summons. Spear and Power Staff weapons if you care. Also, make sure you entered the <b>Chocobo Forest</b> on the other side of the Sea Floor Cave (where Catoblepas was).</p>
    <br>
    <p>You should have 26 Blue Magic also, not counting Doom you can learn from Exdeath.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Beating Exdeath will move the player towards World 3 - Merged World.</p>
</div>
<div id="box">
    <h3>Blue Magic Note</h3>
    
    <p>You can learn <b>Doom</b> from Exdeath.</p>
</div>
<li>When ready, you'll fight Exdeath at the end of his castle. A bunch of scenes follow, naturally.</li>
